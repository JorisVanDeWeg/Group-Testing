# Evaluation of Group Testing Algorithms - Project

## Introduction

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of two key algorithms used for group testing: the Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP) and the Definite Defectives (DD) algorithm. These algorithms are designed to identify defective items within a large set by performing group tests, a method that can be significantly more efficient than individual testing.

## Algorithms

### Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP)

- `COMP.m`: This MATLAB function implements the COMP algorithm, which is an efficient method to quickly identify non-defective items within a large dataset.

### Definite Defectives (DD)

- `DD.m`: The MATLAB function provided here implements the DD algorithm, focusing on the precise identification of defective items based on group test outcomes.

### Matching Pursuit (MP)

- `MP.m`: Although not commonly used in the context of group testing, the MP algorithm has been adapted for this project to work with boolean sparse recovery, which is a main goal of the boolean compressed sensing problem.
